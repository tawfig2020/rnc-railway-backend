## ðŸ“Š What Your Database Needs

### **Minimum Data to Get Started:**

1. **1 Admin User** (you)
2. **3-5 Categories** (handicrafts, textiles, etc.)
3. **1-2 Vendors** (can be test vendors)
4. **5-10 Products** (linked to vendors and categories)

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Win: Test with One Product

Instead of adding lots of data, let's test with just ONE product:

### **Step 1: Create Category**
- Name: "Handicrafts"
- Description: "Handmade crafts and traditional items"

### **Step 2: Create Vendor**
- Business Name: "Test Crafts"
- Description: "Test vendor for handicrafts"
- Categories: ["crafts"]

### **Step 3: Create Product**
- Name: "Test Basket"
- Description: "Beautiful handwoven basket"
- Price: 45
- Category: (Select "Handicrafts")
- Vendor: (Select "Test Crafts")
- Image: Use any image URL from Unsplash
- Stock: 10

### **Step 4: Test Frontend**
Refresh your marketplace page - you should see the product!

## ðŸš€ Once You Have Data

Your frontend will automatically:
- âœ… Display products in the marketplace
- âœ… Show vendor information
- âœ… Enable filtering by category
- âœ… Allow search functionality
- âœ… Show product details
- âœ… Enable add to cart

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip

**Start small!**
- Don't try to add 50 products at once
- Add 1-2 products first to test
- Make sure everything works
- Then add more data gradually
