# Netlify 404 Error - FIXED

## ✅ Problem Identified

**Error:** "Page not found - Looks like you've followed a broken link..."

**Cause:** React Router needs a redirect rule for client-side routing to work on Netlify.

**Solution:** Added `_redirects` file to handle all routes.

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

### Created File: `client/public/_redirects`

**Content:**
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

**What this does:**
- Redirects ALL routes to `index.html`
- Allows React Router to handle routing
- Returns 200 status (not 404)
- Works for all pages (Home, About, Login, Admin, etc.)

## 🔄 Rebuild Required

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Still getting 404 after deployment

**Solution 1:** Clear browser cache
```
Press Ctrl + Shift + R (hard refresh)
```

**Solution 2:** Check if `_redirects` file is in build folder
```powershell
dir C:\Users\Lenovo\CascadeProjects\RNC\CascadeProjects\windsurf-project\client\build\_redirects
```

**Solution 3:** Verify Netlify processed the file
- Go to Netlify Dashboard
- Click on your site
- Go to "Deploys" → Latest deploy
- Check "Deploy log"
- Look for "_redirects" in the log

### Issue: Build doesn't include `_redirects`

**Solution:** Rebuild
```powershell
cd client
npm run build
```

Verify file exists:
```powershell
dir build\_redirects
```
