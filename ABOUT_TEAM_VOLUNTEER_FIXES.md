# 🔧 ABOUT PAGE, TEAM PAGE & VOLUNTEER LINKS - ALL FIXES COMPLETE

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ All Issues Fixed

---

## 🎯 ISSUES FIXED

### **1. ✅ Removed Top Buttons from About Page Hero Section**

**Problem:** Two unnecessary buttons ("Join Our Team" and "Contact Us") in the hero section.

**Solution:** Removed both buttons from the hero section of About.js and AboutEnhanced.js

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/pages/About.js` - Removed hero buttons
- `client/src/pages/AboutEnhanced.js` - Removed hero buttons

**Result:** Clean hero section with just title and subtitle, no buttons cluttering the top.

---

### **2. ✅ Fixed Bottom Section Buttons - Already Correct**

**Status:** The bottom section buttons were already correctly configured:

**"Know Our Team" Button:**
- ✅ Text: "Know Our Team" (correct)
- ✅ Route: `/team` (correct)
- ✅ Action: Navigates to Team page

**"Volunteer With Us" Button:**
- ✅ Text: "Volunteer With Us" (correct)
- ✅ Route: `/role-application/volunteer` (correct)
- ✅ Action: Opens volunteer application form

**No changes needed** - These were already properly configured.

---

### **3. ✅ Updated Team Page Labels**

**Problem:** Page used "Executive Board" instead of "Executive Team"

**Solution:** Updated all references from "Executive Board" to "Executive Team"

**Changes Made:**
- Tab label: "Executive Board" → "Executive Team"
- Section heading: "Executive Board" → "Executive Team"
- Comment: "Executive Board" → "Executive Team"

**File Modified:**
- `client/src/pages/Team.js`

---

### **4. ✅ Fixed All Volunteer Links Across Site**

**Problem:** Some "Volunteer With Us" links were going to `/volunteer-internship` instead of the application form.

**Solution:** Updated all volunteer links to go to `/role-application/volunteer`

**Files Checked & Fixed:**

✅ **About.js** - Already correct (`/role-application/volunteer`)
✅ **AboutEnhanced.js** - Fixed from `/volunteer-internship` to `/role-application/volunteer`
✅ **HomePage.js** - Already correct (`/volunteer-application`)
✅ **Team.js** - Already correct (`/role-application/volunteer`)

**All volunteer links now properly route to the application form!**
