## 🚀 Render Deployment

### Auto-Deploy Status:
Since the repository is connected to Render, it should **auto-deploy** when you push changes.

### Manual Deploy (if needed):
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your backend service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
4. Wait ~5-10 minutes

### Verify Deployment:
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-render-url.onrender.com/api/health

# Test campaigns endpoint
curl https://your-render-url.onrender.com/api/campaigns

# Test courses endpoint
curl https://your-render-url.onrender.com/api/courses
```

## ⚠️ Important: Database Migration

**After Render deployment, run this migration:**

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Lenovo\CascadeProjects\RNC\CascadeProjects\windsurf-project
node scripts\migrate-refugee-to-member.js
```

**This will:**
- Update all users from role 'refugee' to 'member'
- Prevent authentication errors
- Takes ~30 seconds

**Why it's critical:**
- Backend now expects 'member' role
- Old 'refugee' role will cause login failures
