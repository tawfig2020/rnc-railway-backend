## 🔍 How to Check Your Render Backends

### Step 1: Login to Render
Visit: https://dashboard.render.com/

### Step 2: View Your Services
You should see something like:

```
Services:
├── rncplatform (Web Service)
│   └── URL: https://rncplatform.onrender.com
│   └── Status: Running
│   └── Last Deploy: [date]
│
└── rnc-railway-backend (Web Service)
    └── URL: https://rnc-railway-backend.onrender.com
    └── Status: Running
    └── Last Deploy: [recent date]
```

### Step 3: Check Which One is Working
Click on each service and check:
- **Environment variables** - Are they set?
- **Logs** - Do you see "MongoDB Connected"?
- **Health check** - Visit `/health` endpoint

---

## 🧪 Test Your Backends

### Test Old Backend:
```bash
curl https://rncplatform.onrender.com/health
```

**Expected:** Basic health response (no database info)

### Test New Backend:
```bash
curl https://rnc-railway-backend.onrender.com/health
```

**Expected:** Health response WITH "database": "Connected"

## 📊 Backend Comparison

| Feature | Old Backend | New Backend |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **URL** | rncplatform.onrender.com | rnc-railway-backend.onrender.com |
| **Database** | ❌ Not connected | ✅ Connected |
| **Admin User** | ❌ Not configured | ✅ Working |
| **Environment Vars** | ⚠️ Missing | ✅ Complete |
| **Status** | ⚠️ Incomplete | ✅ Ready |
| **Recommendation** | Don't use | **Use this!** |

## 🎯 My Recommendation

### **DO THIS:**

1. **Backend:** Use the new one (no action needed)
   - URL: `https://rnc-railway-backend.onrender.com`
   - Status: Already working
   - Action: None

2. **Frontend:** Deploy new build to Netlify
   - Location: `client/build` folder
   - Action: Drag & drop to Netlify
   - Time: 1 minute

3. **Test:** Login to your site
   - URL: https://rncmalaysia.org/login
   - Credentials: admin@refugeenetwork.com / admin123456
   - Expected: Success!

### **DON'T DO THIS:**

- ❌ Don't redeploy the old backend (unless you want to)
- ❌ Don't change environment variables on new backend (it's working)
- ❌ Don't delete the old backend (keep it as backup)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### About GitHub:
- Your backend code is already pushed to GitHub
- Render will pull the latest code when you redeploy
- No need to push again (already done)

### About Environment Variables:
- These are NOT in GitHub (for security)
- Must be set in Render dashboard
- Each service has its own environment variables

### About Deployment:
- Render auto-deploys from GitHub (if configured)
- Manual deploy pulls latest code from GitHub
- Takes 2-3 minutes to complete
