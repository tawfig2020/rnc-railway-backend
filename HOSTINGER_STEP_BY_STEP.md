## üìÅ WHAT YOU NEED

**Build Folder Location:**
```
C:\Users\Lenovo\CascadeProjects\RNC\CascadeProjects\windsurf-project\client\build
```

**I already opened this folder in Windows Explorer for you!**

---

## üéØ STEP-BY-STEP DEPLOYMENT TO HOSTINGER

### **STEP 1: Login to Hostinger**

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: **https://hpanel.hostinger.com/**
3. Enter your Hostinger credentials
4. Click **"Login"**

---

### **STEP 2: Access File Manager**

1. After login, you'll see your dashboard
2. Find your website: **rncmalaysia.net**
3. Click on **rncmalaysia.net**
4. Look for **"File Manager"** button (usually on the right side)
5. Click **"File Manager"**

**Alternative path:**
- Click **"Files"** in left menu
- Then click **"File Manager"**

---

### **STEP 3: Navigate to public_html**

1. In File Manager, you'll see a list of folders
2. Look for **"public_html"** folder
3. **Double-click** on `public_html` to open it
4. This is where your website files go

---

### **STEP 4: Backup Old Files (Optional but Recommended)**

**Option A: Create Backup Folder**
1. In File Manager, click **"New Folder"**
2. Name it: `backup_old_site`
3. Select ALL current files in `public_html`
4. Click **"Move"** or drag them to `backup_old_site`

**Option B: Delete Old Files**
1. Select ALL files in `public_html`
2. Click **"Delete"** button (trash icon)
3. Confirm deletion

**I recommend Option A (backup) for safety!**

---

### **STEP 5: Upload New Build Files**

**Method 1: Drag and Drop (Easiest)**

1. In File Manager, make sure you're in `public_html` folder
2. Look for **"Upload"** button (usually top right)
3. Click **"Upload"** button
4. A file upload dialog will appear

5. **Go to the build folder I opened:**
   - Switch to Windows Explorer
   - You should see the `build` folder open
   - Press `Ctrl + A` to select ALL files and folders inside build
   
6. **Drag ALL selected files** from Explorer to the Hostinger upload area
   - OR click "Select Files" and browse to the build folder
   - Select ALL files and folders inside build
   
7. **Important:** Upload the CONTENTS of build folder, not the build folder itself!

**Files you should see uploading:**
- index.html
- manifest.json
- robots.txt
- asset-manifest.json
- favicon.ico
- logo192.png
- logo512.png
- static/ (folder with css, js, media inside)

8. Wait for upload to complete (3-5 minutes depending on internet speed)

---

### **STEP 6: Verify Files Uploaded**

After upload completes, check that `public_html` contains:

```
public_html/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          ‚Üê Main file (MUST be here)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ robots.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ asset-manifest.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ favicon.ico
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logo192.png
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logo512.png
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ static/             ‚Üê Folder (MUST be here)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ css/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ media/
```

**If you see a `build` folder inside `public_html`, that's WRONG!**
- Move all files OUT of the build folder
- Delete the empty build folder

---

### **STEP 7: Create .htaccess File**

**This is CRITICAL for React Router to work!**

1. In File Manager (still in `public_html`), click **"New File"**
2. Name it exactly: `.htaccess` (don't forget the dot!)
3. Click **"Create"**

4. **Right-click** on `.htaccess` file
5. Click **"Edit"**

6. **Copy this content** (from htaccess-for-hostinger.txt):

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-l
  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
```

7. **Paste** the content into the .htaccess file
8. Click **"Save"** or **"Save Changes"**
9. Close the editor

---

### **STEP 8: Set File Permissions (If Needed)**

1. **Right-click** on `public_html` folder
2. Select **"Permissions"** or **"Change Permissions"**
3. Set to: **755**
4. Check **"Apply to subdirectories"**
5. Click **"OK"**

---

### **STEP 9: Clear Cache**

**Clear Hostinger Cache (if available):**
1. Go back to Hostinger dashboard
2. Look for **"Cache"** or **"Website"** settings
3. Click **"Clear Cache"** if available

**Clear Your Browser Cache:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select **"Cached images and files"**
3. Click **"Clear data"**

---

### **STEP 10: Test Your Website**

1. **Open a new browser tab**
2. Go to: **https://rncmalaysia.net**
3. **Homepage should load!**

**If you see errors:**
- Wait 2-3 minutes (DNS propagation)
- Clear browser cache again
- Try incognito/private mode

## ‚ö†Ô∏è TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Problem: 404 Error on Page Refresh**

- Make sure it's named exactly `.htaccess`
- Verify content is correct
- Check it's in `public_html` folder

### **Problem: Homepage Shows Directory Listing**
**Solution:** Check index.html location
- index.html must be directly in `public_html`
- NOT in a subfolder

### **Problem: "Network Error" When Testing**
**Solution:** Check backend
- Go to: https://rnc-railway-backend.onrender.com/health
- Should show: "Database: Connected"
- If not, wait for Render deployment to complete

### **Problem: Old Site Still Showing**
**Solution:** Clear all caches
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)
- Try incognito mode
- Wait 5 minutes for CDN cache to clear

### **Problem: CSS Not Loading**
**Solution:** Check static folder
- Verify `static` folder uploaded correctly
- Check file permissions (755)
- Clear browser cache

### **Problem: Can't Upload Files**
**Solution:** 
- Check file size limits in Hostinger
- Try uploading in smaller batches
