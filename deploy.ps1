Fix: Community Projects & Course Management - Full CRUD with Admin Controls

- Fixed Community Projects Management panel showing 'No projects found'
- Added optional auth middleware for admin access to all campaigns
- Enhanced UI with filters, bulk actions, and statistics dashboard
- Fixed Course Management 'Add New Course' validation errors
- Added required fields: level, duration, language with defaults
- Extended Course model with admin management fields
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Added comprehensive documentation

Backend Changes:
- routes/campaigns.js: Optional auth + admin access to all statuses
- routes/courses.js: Relaxed validation + auto instructor creation
- models/Course.js: Added instructorName, schedule, location, etc.
- railway-backend-only: Applied same fixes for production

Frontend Changes:
- CommunityProjectsManagement: Filters, bulk actions, statistics
- CourseManagement: Added level, duration, language fields

Docs:
- COMMUNITY_PROJECTS_ENHANCEMENT.md
- COURSE_MANAGEMENT_FIX.md
- DEPLOY_TO_GITHUB.md
- deploy.ps1
