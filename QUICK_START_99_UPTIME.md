## 🎯 What YOU Need to Do (15 Minutes)

This is the **easiest and most effective** solution:

### **Step 2: Deploy Frontend with Keep-Alive (10 minutes)**

I've created the keep-alive code. You just need to deploy it:

```bash
# 1. Go to client folder
cd c:\Users\Lenovo\CascadeProjects\RNC\CascadeProjects\windsurf-project\client

# 2. Build
npm run build

# 3. Upload the 'build' folder to Netlify
# (Drag and drop to Netlify dashboard)
```

**Files I Created:**
- `client/src/utils/keepAlive.js` - Pings backend every 10 minutes
- Updated `client/src/App.js` - Auto-starts the service
