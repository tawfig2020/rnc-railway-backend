# 🔧 Fix Netlify Login Issue - rncmalaysia.org

## 🔍 Problem Identified

Your Netlify site at **rncmalaysia.org** is trying to connect to the **OLD backend** which doesn't have the database properly configured.

### Current Situation:
- ❌ **Old Backend:** `https://rncplatform.onrender.com` (No database connected)
- ✅ **New Backend:** `https://rnc-railway-backend.onrender.com` (Database connected, working)

### Error You're Seeing:
```
Network error. Please check your connection or try again later.
```

This happens because the frontend is trying to reach the old backend URL.

## 📝 What I'll Do Now

1. ✅ Rebuild frontend with correct backend URL
2. ✅ Create new build folder
3. ✅ Provide you with deployment instructions

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Why Two Backends?
- **Old:** `rncplatform.onrender.com` - Your original deployment (not fully configured)
- **New:** `rnc-railway-backend.onrender.com` - Latest deployment with all fixes

### Which One to Use?
**Always use:** `https://rnc-railway-backend.onrender.com/api`

This backend has:
- ✅ MongoDB Atlas connected
- ✅ Admin user configured
- ✅ All fixes applied
- ✅ External access verified

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### After I Rebuild:

1. **Deploy New Build to Netlify:**
   - I'll provide the new `build` folder
   - Drag it to your Netlify site
   - Wait 30-60 seconds

2. **Test Login:**
   - Go to: https://rncmalaysia.org/login
   - Use: admin@refugeenetwork.com / admin123456
   - Should work!

3. **Verify:**
   - Check browser console (F12) - no errors
   - Login should succeed
   - Admin panel should load

## 🔧 Alternative: Update Existing Render Backend

If you want to keep using `rncplatform.onrender.com`:

1. **Go to Render Dashboard:**
   - https://dashboard.render.com/
   - Select **rncplatform** service

2. **Update Environment Variables:**
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://tawfig2020ifbp:mRhNa1sFvlJRgbeW@rncmalaysia.dfz2nfi.mongodb.net/refugee-network
   JWT_SECRET=9f72b9d6c4b14e34a2c1d7f80cdd1a8f5d01a38f94247689b3d7e5c6a1f09e44
   ```

3. **Redeploy:**
   - Manual Deploy → Deploy latest commit

But I recommend using the new backend as it's already configured and working!
