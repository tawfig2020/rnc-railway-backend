### ‚úÖ Main Repository (rncplatform) - DEPLOYED
**Repository:** https://github.com/tawfig2020/rncplatform  
**Commit:** 4a1c74b

**Files Updated:**
1. ‚úÖ Backend files (same as above)
2. ‚úÖ Documentation:

   - `COURSE_MANAGEMENT_FIX.md`
   - `DEPLOY_TO_GITHUB.md`
   - `QUICK_DEPLOY.md`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Frontend (Client) - NEEDS MANUAL COMMIT

**Issue:** The client folder is a Git submodule, so changes need to be committed separately.

**Frontend Files Modified (Not Yet Committed):**
1. `client/src/components/admin/sections/CommunityProjectsManagement.js`
   - Added statistics dashboard
   - Added filters (status, category, search)
   - Added bulk actions (approve, reject, delete)
   - Added checkboxes for selection
   - Enhanced UI with better error handling

2. `client/src/components/admin/sections/CourseManagement.js`
   - Added Level dropdown (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
   - Added Language field
   - Added Duration field (in minutes)
   - Fixed form data to include all required fields
   - Improved instructor handling

## How to Deploy Frontend Changes

Since the client is a submodule, you need to commit changes separately:

### Option 1: Commit Frontend Changes
```powershell
cd C:\Users\Lenovo\CascadeProjects\RNC\CascadeProjects\windsurf-project\client

# Add the modified files
git add src/components/admin/sections/CommunityProjectsManagement.js
git add src/components/admin/sections/CourseManagement.js

# Commit
git commit -m "Fix: Enhanced Community Projects & Course Management UI

- CommunityProjectsManagement: Added filters, bulk actions, statistics
- CourseManagement: Added Level, Language, Duration fields
- Improved error handling and user feedback"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin master
```

### Option 2: Update Submodule Reference in Main Repo
After committing client changes, update the main repo:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\Lenovo\CascadeProjects\RNC\CascadeProjects\windsurf-project

# Update submodule reference
git add client
git commit -m "Update client submodule with latest fixes"
git push origin master
```
