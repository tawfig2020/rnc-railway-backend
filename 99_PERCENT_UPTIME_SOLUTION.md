## ✅ Layer 2: Frontend Keep-Alive (AUTOMATIC)

I've already implemented this for you! ✅

**What It Does:**
- Automatically pings backend every 10 minutes when users are on your site
- Wakes backend when users return to the tab
- Only runs in production (not in development)
- Zero impact on user experience

**Files Created:**
1. `client/src/utils/keepAlive.js` - Keep-alive service
2. Updated `client/src/App.js` - Auto-starts the service

**How It Works:**
```javascript
// Automatically pings backend every 10 minutes
// Logs: "[KeepAlive] Backend pinged successfully at 9:47:23 AM"
```

**To Deploy:**
```bash
cd client
npm run build
# Then upload build folder to Netlify
```

## ✅ Layer 3: Backend Optimizations (DONE)

Already implemented in your backend! ✅

**What's Already Done:**
- ✅ Health monitoring endpoint
- ✅ Graceful shutdown
- ✅ Memory management
- ✅ Error tracking
- ✅ Request timeouts
- ✅ Automatic token cleanup

## 📊 Expected Results

### **Before (Current State):**
- ⏰ Backend sleeps after 15 minutes
- 🐌 30-60 second wake-up time
- ❌ Users see errors during wake-up
- 📉 ~85% uptime

### **After (With All Layers):**

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

### **Test 1: Verify UptimeRobot**
1. Go to UptimeRobot dashboard
2. Check monitor status - should be "Up"
3. Wait 5 minutes
4. Check "Response Times" graph - should show regular pings

### **Test 2: Verify Frontend Keep-Alive**
1. Deploy frontend with new code
2. Open your site: <https://rncmalaysia.net>
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Look for: `[KeepAlive] Backend pinged successfully`
5. Should appear every 10 minutes

### **Test 3: Verify Backend Health**
```bash
curl https://rnc-railway-backend.onrender.com/api/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "uptime": "2h 15m",
  "memory": { "heapUsed": "45MB" },
  "metrics": {
    "totalRequests": 1523,
    "errorRate": "0.20%"
