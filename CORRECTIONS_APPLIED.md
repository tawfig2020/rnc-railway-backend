# ✅ CORRECTIONS APPLIED

## 🎨 Logo Fix

**Changed logo path to:** `/assets/rnc-logo (2).png`

This should be the original logo with green/blue checkmark design (13620 bytes file).

The white square background was already removed from Navbar in previous fix.

## 🔗 Hero Section Buttons Status

**Current buttons in hero section:**
1. ✅ "Explore Our Programs" → `/our-services`
